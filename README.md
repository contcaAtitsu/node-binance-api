## What are the Options for Acrobat XI Pro Users?

They also benefit from the latest functional enhancements and improved security measures from Adobe. However, these versions may have different user interfaces, workflows, or pricing models than Acrobat XI Pro, which may require some adjustment or investment from the users.
